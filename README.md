Final Projects of Entri

Project Title:
Road Traffic Accident Analysis in the United Kingdom
📝 Project Overview:

        Road accidents remain a major safety concern in the United Kingdom. Every year, thousands of incidents result in injuries, fatalities, and property damage. This project focuses on analyzing UK road accident data to uncover patterns and causes behind these incidents.

Key aspects include:
  📅 Time-based trends – Analyze accidents by hour, day, and time of day (e.g., night, morning).
  🌧️ Weather and road surface conditions – Assess how environmental factors affect risk.
  ⚠️ Carriageway hazards – Study the role of hazards like obstructions or roadworks.
  🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing – Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and noise.
  📊 Visual storytelling – Use graphs and summaries to communicate findings clearly.
  🎯 Goal – Support policymakers and the public in making roads safer through insights.


🧩 Project Objectives:
  🧹 Clean and preprocess the road accident dataset for consistent and usable formats.
  ⏰ Extract time-based features like hour, day, and time segments (morning, night, etc.).
  📈 Analyze accident distributions across:
      🕐 Time of day
      📅 Day of the week
      🌧️ Weather conditions
      ⚠️ Road and hazard conditions
  📊 Visualize key trends and accident hotspots using charts and graphs.
  🎯 Draw insights and provide recommendations to reduce road accidents.
